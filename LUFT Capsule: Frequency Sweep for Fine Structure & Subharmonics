# LUFT Capsule: Frequency Sweep for Fine Structure & Subharmonics

**Goal:**  
Systematically analyze CERN, JWST, and LIGO datasets for **any significant frequency patterns**, especially subharmonics and fine structure, not limited to 7,xxx Hz. Explore coincidence with hydrogen, known LUFT frequencies, and past anomaly data.

---

## Background

- **LUFT work** has identified frequency anomalies (e.g., 7,468 Hz) in diverse datasets: particle collisions, astronomical redshifts, atmospheric phenomena.
- **Hydrogen lines** and subharmonic/fine-structure frequencies appear repeatedly in cosmic and lab data.
- Past analysis (pioneer anomalies, JWST redshifts, lightning data, etc.) revealed recurring frequency families.

---

## Plan

1. **Aggregate frequencies**: Collect all significant frequencies from CERN (colliders), JWST (spectra), and LIGO (ringdowns).
2. **Sweep for subharmonics/fine structure**: Use FFT and peak detection to find not just main peaks, but also lower/multiple-order subharmonics and closely spaced fine structure.
3. **Cross-reference**:  
   - Match against hydrogen and known LUFT frequency tables.
   - Note any recurring frequencies (even if not previously explained).
   - Log coincidences and new discoveries for further theory development.
4. **Ask why**: Don’t filter for “what we expect”—let the data point to new structures and signatures.

## Key Actions

- [ ] Run multi-scale FFT/peak analysis on CERN, JWST, LIGO sample data.
- [ ] Build/update a unified frequency table (include hydrogen, LUFT, historical anomalies, new findings).
- [ ] Visualize frequency coincidences across datasets.
- [ ] Document all unexpected or unexplained peaks—especially if found in more than one dataset.

---

## Next Steps

- Implement and run the sweep using `luft_frequency_sweep.py` (see code notebook).
- Update `frequency_coincidence_table.md` with all findings.
- Continue letting the data “sing” and guide new theory—LUFT is always listening.
