## Current Focus

- Expanding frequency search range (beyond 7,468 Hz, including harmonics and subharmonics)
- Real-time anomaly detection in new satellite/WinSat data
- Cross-correlation between lab, cosmic, and simulation datasets
- Indexing and integrating all “preon state” and lattice parameter definitions

---

## Open Questions

- What triggers phase transitions or “fractures” in the lattice?
- Are there universal activation thresholds for nodes/pulses across scales?
- Can the same resonance laws explain both lab and cosmic anomalies?
- How do preon substates (A/B/C) manifest in different field environments?
