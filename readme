# LUFT: The Living Unified Field Theory Project

**Unifying the structure, dynamics, and emergent patterns of space, time, energy, and matter.**

---

## 🌌 Project Vision

LUFT is an open exploration of the deep structure and unification of the physical world.  
We build and share tools, data, and insights to connect the fundamental movements of energy and space—across physics, astronomy, cosmology, and beyond.

Our aim:  
- To map the underlying construction and dynamics of reality.
- To make unification a living, collaborative process—open to all curious minds.

---

## 🚀 What We Do

- **Data Analysis:**  
  Algorithms to find patterns, frequencies, structures, and anomalies in real physics data (satellite, particle, radio, astronomical, and more).
- **Theory & Simulation:**  
  Open notebooks and code for exploring unified models—across scales, fields, and disciplines.
- **Community Collaboration:**  
  A growing, global team of scientists, students, engineers, and explorers.
