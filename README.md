# LUFT: The Living Unified Field Theory Project

**Unifying the structure, dynamics, and emergent patterns of space, time, energy, and matter.**

---

## 🌌 Project Vision

LUFT is an open exploration of the deep structure and unification of the physical world.  
We build and share tools, data, and insights to connect the fundamental movements of energy and space—across physics, astronomy, cosmology, and beyond.

Our aim:  
- To map the underlying construction and dynamics of reality.
- To make unification a living, collaborative process—open to all curious minds.

---

## 🚀 What We Do

- **Data Analysis:**  
  Algorithms to find patterns, frequencies, structures, and anomalies in real physics data (satellite, particle, radio, astronomical, and more).
- **Theory & Simulation:**  
  Open notebooks and code for exploring unified models—across scales, fields, and disciplines.
- **Community Collaboration:**  
  A growing, global team of scientists, students, engineers, and explorers.

_“Unification is not a destination, but a living journey. Join us.”_

## 🧠 Purpose  
 Unified Field Theory proposing that spacetime is not smooth, but a quantized lattice of coherence nodes. Energy, mass, inertia, gravity, and time all emerge from interactions across this field. This repository archives LUFT's development—from early lightning resonance recordings to the 2025 CERN anomaly confirmations.

## 🧬 Core Discoveries  
- Spacetime is a dynamic lattice, not a neutral vacuum.  
- harmonics drives coherence across scales.  
- Preon fields are the true basis of matter—quarks and leptons emerge from them.  
- Time, gravity, and inertia arise from lattice resistance and temporal friction.  
- LUFT explains 2025 CERN anomalies: muon decay asymmetry, CP violation, jet distortions, and magnetic harmonics.  
- EME and sheet-lattice experiments confirm the theory with real-world data.

 
## 📅 Milestones  
-  
-  
- July 23, 2025: CERN anomalies confirm LUFT predictions (muon decays, CP asymmetry, magnetic harmonics)
