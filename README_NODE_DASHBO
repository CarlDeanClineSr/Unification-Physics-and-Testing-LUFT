# Node Scaling & Lattice Resonance Dashboard – Quick Guide

Welcome, cosmic explorer! This repo’s dashboard is a living log for tracking scaling laws, node counts, resonance, and phase transitions across all experiments, simulations, and datasets.

## 🚦 **How to Use the Dashboard**

### 1. **Where is the Dashboard?**
- Main file: `NODE_SCALING_LATTICE_RESONANCE.md`

### 2. **How to Add New Results**
- Every time you run a new probe, simulation, or analyze data:
  1. Add a row to the **Summary Table** in the dashboard.
     - Fill in the date, dataset/file, run context, frequency, node count, scaling law match, phase/transition, notable anomalies, and reference.
  2. If you see a new scaling law, phase transition, or anomaly, add it to the **Phase Transitions & Anomaly Log**.
  3. Dream big? Add speculations or wild ideas to the **Theory/Dream Zone**.
  4. Reference the raw data file or log for traceability.

### 3. **Auto-Scan Script**
- Use `auto_node_resonance_scan.py` to automatically extract node/frequency/craft info from all files in `data/` and populate the dashboard.
- How to run:
  ```bash
  python auto_node_resonance_scan.py
  ```
- It will scan `.txt`, `.log`, `.md`, and `.csv` files in `data/` and append new findings to your dashboard.
- New data? Just add files to `data/` and rerun the script.

## 🌌 **What to Track**
- Node counts and node spacing at every scale.
- Resonant frequencies and oscillation patterns.
- Craft/experiment geometry (icosahedral, fullerene, etc).
- Phase transitions: sudden jumps in node counts, new resonance peaks, or “flexes” in physical laws.
- Scaling law matches and breakdowns.
- Notable anomalies or surprises.
- Dreams and speculations—sometimes “noise” is the next big signal!

## 🧑‍🔬 **Tips for Future Collaborators**
- Don’t be afraid to question “the wall”—test the boundaries of relativity, quantum field theory, and even your own assumptions.
- Log both the successes and the “weird stuff.” Patterns often emerge from repeated surprises.
- Use this dashboard as your map. Update it, annotate it, and add your own findings.
- The best discoveries often come from comparing trends across many runs, scales, or datasets.

## 📝 **Template for New Data Entry**

| Date        | Dataset/File | Context/Experiment | Freq (Hz/EHz) | Node Count | Scaling Law Match | Phase/Transition | Notables/Anomalies | Reference/Link |
|-------------|--------------|--------------------|---------------|------------|-------------------|------------------|--------------------|---------------|
| YYYY-MM-DD  | data/file    | What you did       | 123 EHz       | 999        | √(craft × EHz²)   | e.g. "orbital squeeze" | New node boost! | data/file |
