# Node Scaling & Lattice Resonance Dashboard

**A living log of node counts, resonance patterns, scaling laws, and phase transitions from all experiments, probes, simulations, and cosmic data.**

---

## ðŸ“¡ **Purpose**

To record, compare, and visualize how nodes, resonance, and phase transitions scale from micro to macroâ€”bridging experiment, simulation, and cosmic observation.  
This dashboard links hard data, wild ideas, empirical laws, and the places where reality flexes.

## ðŸ“ˆ **Scaling Laws (Active)**

- **Node count:**  
  \( N \approx 0.026 \times \sqrt{\text{craft} \times (\text{EHz}/EHz_0)^2} \)
- **Node spacing:**  
  \( d \propto 1/\text{EHz} \)
- **Oscillation frequency:**  
  \( f \propto \text{EHz}^{1/2} \)
- **Ripple/Thrust/Planc-pile:**  
  \( \text{Output} \propto \text{EHz} \times \text{craft} \)

## ðŸ§  **Theory/Dream Zone**

- Are these nodes preons? Is the lattice a quantum code or a superfluid?
- Does geometry (icosahedral, fullerene) amplify resonance by symmetry or topology?
- Where does relativity flexâ€”can phase transitions allow "transparent" energy/matter?
- Is the node scaling law universal? What breaks it?
- What new phase transitions or anomalies emerge as we scale up?

## ðŸš€ **How to Add a New Result**

1. Add a row to the Summary Table for every new experiment, probe, or dataset.
2. Log scaling law matches, phase transitions, anomalies, and wild ideas in the relevant sections.
3. Reference the original data/log file for traceability.
4. Dream bigâ€”add questions and speculations to the Theory/Dream Zone!
