# Welcome to LUFT!

Thank you for your interest in the Living Unified Field Theory (LUFT) Project!

Whether you’re a physicist, coder, student, or just curious about the universe—your ideas, questions, and contributions are valued here. LUFT is an open, evolving effort to understand the underlying construction and dynamics of space, time, energy, and matter. We believe in open science, global collaboration, and learning together.

**How to Get Started:**
- Read our [README](../README.md) for a project overview and goals.
- Visit our [Wiki](../wiki) for guides, datasets, and key findings.
- Try running our example notebooks or scripts.
- New to GitHub or physics? No problem! Ask questions in [Discussions](../discussions) or open an [Issue](../issues).

**Ways to Contribute:**
- Add new data analyses or theoretical insights.
- Share feedback, ideas, or questions.
- Help improve our docs, code, or community.
- Tell us about related projects or discoveries.

This project is as much about community and curiosity as it is about code and data.  
Welcome aboard—and thank you for helping us build a living, unified science!

_“Unification is not a destination, but a living journey. Join us.”_
